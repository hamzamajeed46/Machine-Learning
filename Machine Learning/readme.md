TITANIC DATASET:
The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of data science and machine
learning. It contains information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which
sank after hitting an iceberg on its maiden voyage in April 1912. The dataset is often
used for teaching and learning purposes, as well as for developing predictive
models.
Here is a brief overview of the features (columns) in the Titanic dataset:
PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
Survived: Indicates whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).
Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class).
Name: Passenger's name.
Sex: Passenger's gender (male or female).
Age: Passenger's age in years.
SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic.
Parch: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic.
Ticket: Ticket number.
Fare: Passenger fare.
Cabin: Cabin number.
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S =
Southampton).
The main objective with the Titanic dataset is typically to predict whether a
passenger survived or not based on the other features. This is a binary classification
problem, where the outcome variable is the "Survived" column.
Researchers and data scientists use this dataset for various purposes, such as:
● Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Analyzing the distributions of different
features, identifying patterns, and visualizing relationships between variables.
● Feature engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to
improve model performance.
● Predictive modeling: Building machine learning models to predict survival
outcomes based on passenger attributes.
● Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of different models using
metrics such as accuracy, precision.
Overall, the Titanic dataset serves as a valuable resource for practicing data analysis
and machine learning techniques, as well as for understanding historical events and
human behavior in critical situations.
